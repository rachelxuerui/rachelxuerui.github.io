    The studio's largest built work yet. A gut renovation of a late 19th century dairy-factory-turned-townhouse in the Tribeca Historic District. The 14-month construction process has been a lesson in flexibility: rapid redesigns to accommodate historical elements (arches, cast iron columns, brickwork) discovered during demolition, and minor re-filings to accommodate a client who kept adding scope (elevator, new floor finishes, an additional kitchen) over the course of construction. Substantial completion is scheduled for early May; two weeks ago, I got a text asking if we can turn the gym into a listening room. ("Of course we can!")
